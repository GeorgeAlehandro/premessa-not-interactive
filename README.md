# premessa-not-interactive

`premessa` is an R package for pre-processing of flow and mass cytometry data, that includes panel editing/renaming for FCS files, bead-based normalization and debarcoding.
The modifications to this package mainly concern the interactivity of the R-shiny session. This is an attempt of making the tool run in a noninteractive session.


## Install premessa

Start an R session and type the following commands

```
library(devtools)
install_github("GeorgeAlehandro/premessa-not-interactive")
```
